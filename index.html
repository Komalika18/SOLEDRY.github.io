        <h2> Introducing SoleDry: A Smart Shoe Drying Box! </h2>
     
        <p>SoleDry is a smart shoe dryer system that ensures your footwear is dried efficiently without compromising quality. Specifically designed for people living in regions with heavy monsoons, for ex: India, Bangladesh, Korea, China, Japan, etc, SoleDry offers a reliable and easy way to take care of your shoes in a way that has never been done before. From the working class to the school-going children, SoleDry is the solution for all the problems your shoe faces during monsoons, be it the wetness that doesn’t dry in the humid atmosphere naturally, or be it the smell that comes with wet shoes, or be it the reduction of the lifespan of the shoe. Sole Dry is the SOLE solution to all your wet shoe problems.</p>
        <h3>2. Motivation</h3>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Wet shoes, especially in countries with long rainy seasons, lead to bad odors, bacterial growth, and a shorter shoe lifespan. Traditional drying methods are often inefficient and can damage shoes due to improper temperature control or excessive moisture retention, making it difficult to maintain shoe quality and hygiene.</p>
        <p><strong>Interesting Because:</strong> SoleDry provides an innovative, automated solution to a common problem by using real-time humidity and temperature control to efficiently dry shoes without compromising their quality. It's particularly useful in humid climates, offering a sustainable way to extend shoe lifespan and improve hygiene.</p>
        <p><strong>Intended Purpose:</strong> The goal is to create an efficient, user-friendly system that dries shoes overnight, prevents odor, and maintains the structural integrity of shoes. It ensures shoes remain fresh and usable, making it a convenient and sustainable tool for everyday life, especially during wet seasons.</p>

        <h3>3. Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining Air Flow: Ensure proper air circulation through vents, exhausts, and fans to promote efficient and uniform drying of shoes.</li>
            <li>Humidity Control: Use sensors and controlled air flow to regulate and maintain optimal humidity levels, preventing excess moisture or drying too fast.</li>
            <li>Temperature Control: Incorporate a reliable heating system to control the temperature inside the box, ensuring shoes dry efficiently without overheating.</li>
            <li>Weight Monitoring: Utilize a weight sensor to track the reduction in shoe weight, enabling precise monitoring of moisture loss during drying.</li>
            <li>LED Display: Show real-time values for humidity, temperature, and weight, along with a calculated percentage indicating how much the shoes have dried based on initial and dry weights.</li>
            <li>Buzzer Notification: Include an alert system (buzzer) to notify the user when the desired dry weight is achieved, signaling that the shoes are fully dry.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>10. Methodology</h2>
    <p>What is your approach to the problem? Our approach to designing a smart shoe dryer tackles the problem of wet and odorous shoes by combining efficient drying with hygiene management and user-friendly controls. Here’s the breakdown:</p>

    <h3>Core Functionality:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Moisture & Odor Control:</strong> Incorporating a heating element with a fan to circulate warm air, promoting quick drying while minimizing condensation. An odor and germ filter is included to reduce bacteria and odors, addressing the hygiene aspect effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Temperature and Humidity Monitoring:</strong> Sensors monitor real-time conditions inside the dryer to optimize heating intensity and ventilation based on moisture levels.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Automation & Safety:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Controlled by ATmega328PB:</strong> The ATmega328PB serves as the main controller, processing sensor inputs to dynamically adjust the heater and fan, maintaining safe and effective drying without overheating.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Relay and Safety Logic:</strong> The ATmega controls relays to manage high-power components, ensuring safe and responsive device operation.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User Experience & Remote Control:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Local Display for Status:</strong> A compact OLED or LCD display shows drying status, humidity, and temperature, giving users a clear, at-a-glance understanding of the device’s operation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Wi-Fi & Blynk IoT Integration:</strong> The ESP32 module connects the device to Wi-Fi and integrates with the Blynk IoT platform, allowing remote monitoring and control. Users can start, stop, or adjust settings via their smartphone, enhancing convenience and accessibility.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design and Maintenance:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Modular & Lightweight Design:</strong> The dryer will have a modular, lightweight enclosure that is easy to disassemble for cleaning, ensuring that maintenance is minimal and user-friendly.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Evaluation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Drying Time:</strong> One of the primary metrics is the time it takes to dry the shoes. The initial target is to dry the shoes within 6 hours. Future improvements will focus on reducing this drying time without increasing energy consumption or causing any damage to the shoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Accuracy of Dryness Detection:</strong> The system will use both weight and humidity as measures to determine when the shoes are fully dry. The accuracy of these readings, such as the weight fluctuation within +/- 50 grams and relative humidity levels, will be key in ensuring the shoes are dried without being overexposed to heat, which can damage them.
        </li>
    </ul>
