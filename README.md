# SOLEDRYhaha

##### üåü Introducing SoleDry: A Smart Shoe Drying Box! üåü
Thrilled to share my latest project at The University of Pennsylvania, where my team designed and implemented SoleDry for the final project for the course ESE 5190: Smart Devices taught by professor Nicholas McGill-Gardner, an automatic shoe-drying system powered by the ATmega328PB microcontroller. This project was part of my journey in embedded systems engineering from August to December 2024, and it was an incredible learning experience!
##### üí° What is SoleDry?
SoleDry is a smart shoe dryer system that ensures your footwear is dried efficiently without compromising quality. Specifically designed for people living in regions with heavy monsoons, for ex: India, Bangladesh, Korea, China, Japan, etc, SoleDry offers a reliable and easy way to take care of your shoes in a way that has never been done before. From the working class to the school-going children, SoleDry is the solution for all the problems your shoe faces during monsoons, be it the wetness that doesn‚Äôt dry in the humid atmosphere naturally, or be it the smell that comes with wet shoes, or be it the reduction of the lifespan of the shoe. Sole Dry is the SOLE solution to all your wet shoe problems. 
* SoleDry offers the user to use 3 modes: 
1. Automatic Mode- in this mode the user just has to put the shoe inside the shoe drying compartment. The system is programmed to automatically measure the weight of the shoe when it's wet and it turns on the drying process while constantly measuring the weight of the shoe, comparing it with the previously registered value( the value gets registered every 30 minutes in the Atmega328PB), It turns off the drying mechanism when the shoe is dry completely when the last two registered values are the same. 
	In addition, the automatic mode also considers overheating of the shoe and preserves the quality of the shoe to its optimum, by turning off the drying system when the temperature inside the shoe compartment reaches close to 40¬∞C. 
2. Manual Mode- The manual mode allows the user to set a custom temperature and time limit for your shoe to dry. 
3. New Profile mode- In the new profile mode you get to set your shoe‚Äôs dry weight, and let the machine know when to stop the drying process. For example, you can set your new shoe with your name like ‚ÄúJack‚Äôs shoes‚Äù, this will register the dry weight of jack‚Äôs shoes. So the next time Jack‚Äôs shoes are placed in the drying compartment, and the profile ‚ÄúJack‚Äôs shoes‚Äù is selected, the system will begin the drying process and will only get turned off when the weight of the shoes reaches the dry weight of his shoes, or when the shoe compartment gets overheated. 

* üîß Technical Highlights:
Baremetal C Programming: Developed the firmware for the system on an ATmega328PB microcontroller.
Sensor Integration:
HDC3020 (Temperature & Humidity Sensor): Monitors and displays real-time conditions, halting the drying process when the temperature exceeds 40¬∞C to protect shoe materials.
NAU7802 (Load Sensor ADC): Tracks shoe weight every second and registers changes every 30 minutes to determine drying completion.
I2C Protocol Communication:  Enabled seamless interaction between the microcontroller and sensors.
Power Management: Successfully integrated a 120V AC heater, two 12V fans, sensors, and AC-DC relays into a single efficient circuit.
Automated Shutoff: The system intelligently halts operation when it detects consistent weight measurements, signaling that the shoes are dry.

### 10. Methodology

What is your approach to the problem?
Our approach to designing a smart shoe dryer tackles the problem of wet and odorous shoes by combining efficient drying with hygiene management and user-friendly controls. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

#### Core Functionality: 

- Moisture & Odor Control: We‚Äôre incorporating a heating element with a fan to circulate warm air, promoting quick drying while minimizing condensation. An odor and germ filter is included to reduce bacteria and odors, addressing the hygiene aspect effectively.

- Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Sensors monitor real-time conditions inside the dryer to optimize heating intensity and ventilation based on moisture levels.

#### Automation & Safety: 

- Controlled by ATmega328PB: The ATmega328PB serves as the main controller, processing sensor inputs to dynamically adjust the heater and fan, maintaining safe and effective drying without overheating. 

- Relay and Safety Logic: The ATmega controls relays to manage high-power components, ensuring safe and responsive device operation.

#### User Experience & Remote Control: 

- Local Display for Status: A compact OLED or LCD display shows drying status, humidity, and temperature, giving users a clear, at-a-glance understanding of the device‚Äôs operation.

- Wi-Fi & Blynk IoT Integration: The ESP32 module connects the device to Wi-Fi and integrates with the Blynk IoT platform, allowing remote monitoring and control. Users can start, stop, or adjust settings via their smartphone, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

#### Design and Maintenance: 

- Modular & Lightweight Design: The dryer will have a modular, lightweight enclosure that is easy to disassemble for cleaning, ensuring that maintenance is minimal and¬†user-friendly.

### 11. Evaluation
- Drying Time: One of the primary metrics is the time it takes to dry the shoes. The initial target is to dry the shoes within 6 hours. Future improvements will focus on reducing this drying time without increasing energy consumption or causing any damage to the shoes.
- Accuracy of Dryness Detection: The system will use both weight and humidity as measures to determine when the shoes are fully dry. The accuracy of these readings like the weight fluctuation within +/- 50 grams and relative humidity levels, will be key in ensuring the shoes are dried without being overexposed to heat, which can damage them.

Yes. 
How did you test? Show proof of work (videos, images, collected data, etc.)
We directly started to work with the components. For the relay we tested with the LEDs to see if the switches would get turned on or not.

We measure the readings every 30 secs but we compare them every 15 mins. After the two/ three consecutive readings are the same, the shoe gets dried and we turn off the heater and the fans. 

**Proof**
[To be noted that that the box wasnt covered so the readings for the temperature and humidity are not that different. Also to be noted that the upper limit for the temp sensor was set to be 40 degrees C]

### 4. Conclusion

Reflect on your project. Some questions to consider: What did you learn from it? What went well? What accomplishments are you proud of? What did you learn/gain from this experience? Did you have to change your approach? What could have been done differently? Did you encounter obstacles that you didn‚Äôt anticipate? What could be a next step for this project?

* This project has been filled with it's ups and downs. All in all it was fun, we all learnt a lot of new things while applying the concepts that were taught in class. The teaching team has been a massive help, Not just 5190 TAs but even Miles who is a TA for 5180, has to be thanked for all the times he has helped us. 

* Lesson learnt - 

1. Before finalising the components, read the datasheet, maybe check if its actually clear and helpful.
2. The Logic analyzer is your friend.
3. How to reverse engineer the code based on the Logic analyzer readings if the datasheet is not helpful. 
4. How to write I2C drivers, although it took a lot of time. 
5. We learnt about Finite State Machines for assembling the code together. 
6. Some new skills that were explored and learnt - Lazer cutting, 3-D printing. 
7. We used two different sensors on the same atmega board.
8. We learnt how to wrok as a team 
9. How to divide tasks amongst the team 
10. How to study concepts together. 
11. How to remain calm and positive when everything else suggests that we shouldn't. 
12. How to frame your code in a proper way.  

* Approach change
  - none
* design change
  - as suggested by the professor, the location of the fans has been changed to optimize the airflow within the box.

* what could have been diffrently?
  - We should have been more through while selecting the components and we should have checked the datasheets to see how detailed and easy to read they were. 
  - We would have chosen a different thing for weight sensing, the load sensor, even though it has a 0.1 grams effor factor, we could have used something else as the datasheet for NAU7802 was not readable for us, and hence we used up a lot of our time to write code using the datasheet.
*  Did you encounter obstacles that you didn‚Äôt anticipate?
  - yes. some datasheets aren't helpful for begginers
  - combining the codes together isn't as easy as it seems. 
* What could be a next step for this project?
  -  Building up the manual mode and the profile mode.
