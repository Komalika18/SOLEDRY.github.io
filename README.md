## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

In a few sentences, describe your final project. This abstract will be used as the description in the evaluation survey forms.

SoleDry
SoleDry is a sustainable solution designed to dry wet shoes, prevent bad odors, and extend shoe lifespan, especially during the monsoon season. The system uses humidity and temperature control to efficiently dry shoes overnight without causing damage. A display provides real-time updates on weight, temperature, and humidity, allowing users to monitor the drying process effectively. This prototype demonstrates the feasibility of maintaining shoe freshness and durability through automated environmental control.

### 2. Motivation

What is the problem that you are trying to solve? Why is this project interesting? What is the intended purpose?

**Problem:** Wet shoes, especially in countries with long rainy seasons, lead to bad odors, bacterial growth, and a shorter shoe lifespan. Traditional drying methods are often inefficient and can damage shoes due to improper temperature control or excessive moisture retention, making it difficult to maintain shoe quality and hygiene.

**Interesting Because:** SoleDry provides an innovative, automated solution to a common problem by using real-time humidity and temperature control to efficiently dry shoes without compromising their quality. It's particularly useful in humid climates, offering a sustainable way to extend shoe lifespan and improve hygiene.

**Intended Purpose:** The goal is to create an efficient, user-friendly system that dries shoes overnight, prevents odor, and maintains the structural integrity of shoes. It ensures shoes remain fresh and usable, making it a convenient and sustainable tool for everyday life, especially during wet seasons.


### 3. Goals

These are to help guide and direct your progress.

1. Maintaining Air Flow: Ensure proper air circulation through vents, exhausts, and fans to promote efficient and uniform drying of shoes.
2. Humidity Control: Use sensors and controlled air flow to regulate and maintain optimal humidity levels, preventing excess moisture or drying too fast.
3. Temperature Control: Incorporate a reliable heating system to control the temperature inside the box, ensuring shoes dry efficiently without overheating.
4. Weight Monitoring: Utilize a weight sensor to track the reduction in shoe weight, enabling precise monitoring of moisture loss during drying.
5. LED Display: Show real-time values for humidity, temperature, and weight, along with a calculated percentage indicating how much the shoes have dried based on initial and dry weights.
6. Buzzer Notification: Include an alert system (buzzer) to notify the user when the desired dry weight is achieved, signaling that the shoes are fully dry.

### 10. Methodology

What is your approach to the problem?
Our approach to designing a smart shoe dryer tackles the problem of wet and odorous shoes by combining efficient drying with hygiene management and user-friendly controls. Here’s the breakdown:

#### Core Functionality: 

- Moisture & Odor Control: We’re incorporating a heating element with a fan to circulate warm air, promoting quick drying while minimizing condensation. An odor and germ filter is included to reduce bacteria and odors, addressing the hygiene aspect effectively.

- Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: Sensors monitor real-time conditions inside the dryer to optimize heating intensity and ventilation based on moisture levels.

#### Automation & Safety: 

- Controlled by ATmega328PB: The ATmega328PB serves as the main controller, processing sensor inputs to dynamically adjust the heater and fan, maintaining safe and effective drying without overheating. 

- Relay and Safety Logic: The ATmega controls relays to manage high-power components, ensuring safe and responsive device operation.

#### User Experience & Remote Control: 

- Local Display for Status: A compact OLED or LCD display shows drying status, humidity, and temperature, giving users a clear, at-a-glance understanding of the device’s operation.

- Wi-Fi & Blynk IoT Integration: The ESP32 module connects the device to Wi-Fi and integrates with the Blynk IoT platform, allowing remote monitoring and control. Users can start, stop, or adjust settings via their smartphone, enhancing convenience and accessibility.

#### Design and Maintenance: 

- Modular & Lightweight Design: The dryer will have a modular, lightweight enclosure that is easy to disassemble for cleaning, ensuring that maintenance is minimal and user-friendly.

### 11. Evaluation
- Drying Time: One of the primary metrics is the time it takes to dry the shoes. The initial target is to dry the shoes within 6 hours. Future improvements will focus on reducing this drying time without increasing energy consumption or causing any damage to the shoes.
- Accuracy of Dryness Detection: The system will use both weight and humidity as measures to determine when the shoes are fully dry. The accuracy of these readings like the weight fluctuation within +/- 50 grams and relative humidity levels, will be key in ensuring the shoes are dried without being overexposed to heat, which can damage them.

**Did you achieve your requirements?**
Yes. 
How did you test? Show proof of work (videos, images, collected data, etc.)
We directly started to work with the components. For the relay we tested with the LEDs to see if the switches would get turned on or not.

We measure the readings every 30 secs but we compare them every 15 mins. After the two/ three consecutive readings are the same, the shoe gets dried and we turn off the heater and the fans. 

**Proof**
[To be noted that that the box wasnt covered so the readings for the temperature and humidity are not that different. Also to be noted that the upper limit for the temp sensor was set to be 40 degrees C]

### 4. Conclusion

Reflect on your project. Some questions to consider: What did you learn from it? What went well? What accomplishments are you proud of? What did you learn/gain from this experience? Did you have to change your approach? What could have been done differently? Did you encounter obstacles that you didn’t anticipate? What could be a next step for this project?

* This project has been filled with it's ups and downs. All in all it was fun, we all learnt a lot of new things while applying the concepts that were taught in class. The teaching team has been a massive help, Not just 5190 TAs but even Miles who is a TA for 5180, has to be thanked for all the times he has helped us. 

* Lesson learnt - 

1. Before finalising the components, read the datasheet, maybe check if its actually clear and helpful.
2. The Logic analyzer is your friend.
3. How to reverse engineer the code based on the Logic analyzer readings if the datasheet is not helpful. 
4. How to write I2C drivers, although it took a lot of time. 
5. We learnt about Finite State Machines for assembling the code together. 
6. Some new skills that were explored and learnt - Lazer cutting, 3-D printing. 
7. We used two different sensors on the same atmega board.
8. We learnt how to wrok as a team 
9. How to divide tasks amongst the team 
10. How to study concepts together. 
11. How to remain calm and positive when everything else suggests that we shouldn't. 
12. How to frame your code in a proper way.  

* Approach change
  - none
* design change
  - as suggested by the professor, the location of the fans has been changed to optimize the airflow within the box.

* what could have been diffrently?
  - We should have been more through while selecting the components and we should have checked the datasheets to see how detailed and easy to read they were. 
  - We would have chosen a different thing for weight sensing, the load sensor, even though it has a 0.1 grams effor factor, we could have used something else as the datasheet for NAU7802 was not readable for us, and hence we used up a lot of our time to write code using the datasheet.
*  Did you encounter obstacles that you didn’t anticipate?
  - yes. some datasheets aren't helpful for begginers
  - combining the codes together isn't as easy as it seems. 
* What could be a next step for this project?
  -  Building up the manual mode and the profile mode.
